Use GCC compiler or the DCC compiler that UNSW created. Works with either.
I haven't checked any other compilers.

To run using gcc, enter the following:
```
gcc -o beats main.c beats.c
```
To run using dcc, enter the following:
```
dcc -o beats main.c beats.c
```

When you run the program, enter '?' to trigger the explanation of how to
interact with the program. 

Enjoy :)
