This is an implementation of a linked list, using integers as our data. We order the list by numerical values, ascending.

# Compiled with

```
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler
```

I haven't used any libraries other than:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
```

So, it should work with almost any compiler.
